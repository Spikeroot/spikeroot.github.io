I've discovered this remarkable means by which to share my exploits! The citizenry of London will never be the same. Imagine, it's held together by this nonsense named after the good Doctor [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)! To those listening, held rapt by intrigue: I shall be using this contrivance to share the fruits of my investigations where those b___y Masters can't get their claws on it. If you're a regular of the _Journal_, this may well interest you.
