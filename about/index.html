	<h1>Vint Squeezel: Correspondent of the Citizenry</h1>
	<p>Citizen Squeezel is the preeminent London authority on the newly-burgeoning field of pseudoanthropology. The peculariarities of the Neath have forced us to reconsider the hard boundaries of anthropology when considering the diversity of apparently sentient beings. The quarterly <em>Journal of Pseudoanthropology</em> documents my time at the frontier of these studies.</p>
